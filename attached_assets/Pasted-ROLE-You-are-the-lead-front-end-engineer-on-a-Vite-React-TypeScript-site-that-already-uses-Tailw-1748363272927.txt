Home page component (HomePage.tsx)

Hero

Full-width section with a background image (/assets/big-whip-hero.jpg – add placeholder Unsplash if none supplied) overlaid with:

Heading text-5xl lg:text-7xl font-extrabold uppercase tracking-wide → “THE BIG WHIP”

Sub-heading “Since 1960 | Family-Owned | Augusta, ME”

CTA buttons: “Order Now” → /menu#big-whip & “View Menu” → /menu

Add subtle pan/zoom using framer-motion (motion.div with scale keyframes).

Specials Grid

Map over SPECIALS → 4 cards (lg:grid-cols-4, gap-6).

Card styling: rounded-2xl shadow-lg p-6 bg-white/80 backdrop-blur.

Include img placeholders (/assets/{id}.jpg) and a Link to /menu#{id}.

Heritage / About Strip

Two-column layout (lg:grid lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-10).

Left: sepia photo placeholder of the original 1960 shop.

Right: copy block:

“Founded in 1960 by Robert E. ‘Whipper’ Wheelock Sr., we’ve been slinging pies & monster sandwiches for over 65 years. Three generations later, that same family recipe – and the famous Big Whip – still anchor every order.”

Use prose class for typography.

Meta / SEO – with react-helmet-async set <title>Whipper’s Pizza | Home of the Big Whip</title> and meta description summarising heritage + Big Whip.

Routing tweak – in App.tsx preload /menu chunk on first viewport entry of any Specials Link (import.meta.glob() + importMenu?.()).

Accessibility & Perf

Lighthouse mobile & desktop ≥ 90; CLS ≈ 0 (reserve hero image height with aspect-[16/9]).

Add alt text to every img.

Ensure color contrast meets AA.

Lazy-load hero image with loading="eager" fetchpriority="high"; other images loading="lazy".

Tests

Jest test HomeHero.test.tsx ensuring hero renders heading & CTA.

Cypress homepage.cy.ts verifying scroll to /menu#big-whip works and hero loads without 404s.

Assets placeholder

Drop four 1200×800 jpg placeholders into /public/assets named big-whip-hero.jpg, whipper.jpg, party.jpg, salad-bowl.jpg.

Document in README that final photography must replace placeholders before production.

House-keeping

Remove any boilerplate sections no longer relevant.

Run npm run lint --fix & npm run format.

Commit: feat(home): add Big Whip hero, specials grid, heritage strip

remove salad bowl any redo the prompt. we will stick with 3 specials to highlight up front. Make "the big whip" the center special and slightly bigger than the other two since it is the focal point
