I have an existing website for Whippers Pizza that you helped generate (live at https://cee25194-ab02-4d33-8ad7-47985c711ada-00-he08hw2l5jjx.worf.replit.dev/). It needs updates for content accuracy, consistency, and improved aesthetics. Please apply the following changes across all relevant files (index.html, about.html, menu.html, contact.html, 404.html, css/style.css, js/script.js).
I. Core Information to Update/Ensure Consistency (Source: Facebook & Previous Prompts):

II. General Aesthetic & Layout Enhancements (css/style.css & HTML structure):
Color Palette Adherence: Ensure the specified warm palette (rich reds like --primary-red: #B71C1C;, creams like --cream: #FFF9C4;, sage-greens like --sage-green: #8BC34A;, darks like --dark-bg: #333;) is used effectively and consistently. Improve contrast where needed for readability.
Typography: Verify 'Inter' font is applied correctly. Improve text hierarchy (heading sizes, paragraph styling) for better readability and visual appeal. Ensure line spacing and margins create a clean, uncluttered look.
Spacing & Alignment: Review padding and margins around sections, cards, text blocks, and images. Ensure elements are well-aligned and the layout feels balanced.
Image Placeholders: If generic placeholders are used (e.g., via.placeholder.com), try to suggest more thematic placeholder images or ensure existing ones like images/placeholder-pizza.jpg are used appropriately and look good within their containers.
Buttons & CTAs: Ensure buttons (.btn, .btn--primary) are visually distinct, inviting, and consistently styled.
Cards (.card): Ensure card elements (for specials, menu items) are well-styled with consistent padding, perhaps a subtle box-shadow or border for definition, and clear separation of content within them.
Responsiveness: Double-check that all pages and sections adapt well to mobile, tablet, and desktop views (breakpoints at 768px and 1024px). Pay special attention to the navigation, hero sections, grids, and forms.
III. Page-Specific Content & Feature Updates:
Across All Pages (especially Footers and repeated info):
Footer: Ensure the address, phone number, and copyright (with JS dynamic year: © <span id="currentYear"></span> Whippers Pizza) are correct and consistently displayed. Include a clear, working link to the Facebook page using one of the social placeholder spots.
Navigation: Verify the sticky navigation works, links are correct, and the mobile hamburger menu functions smoothly (toggling an .nav--open class or similar).
1. index.html (Home Page):
* Hero Section: Ensure the <h1> is compelling (e.g., "Augusta's Landmark Pizza - Over 40 Years!"). The CTA button should be prominent.
* "Our Specials" Section: Populate with 2-3 plausible specials names and prices if they are too generic (e.g., "The Bangor Street Beast Pizza - $17.99", "Family Meal Deal - 
29.99

", openingHoursSpecification for all 7 days 11 AM - 9 PM, url as Facebook for now, menu link) are correctly populated with the information from Section I.
2. about.html (About Page):
* "Our Story" Section: Flesh this out using the Facebook info: "Whipper's Pizza has proudly served as an Augusta, Maine Landmark for over 40 years. Our tradition is built on homemade dough and sauce, crafting delicious pizzas and sandwiches that our community loves, all at a great price. As a dedicated family-run local pizza shop, we cherish our customers and the decades of support."
* "Our Mission & Values" Section: Create content reflecting a commitment to quality, community, family, homemade ingredients, and good value. E.g., "Our mission is to continue the tradition of providing Augusta with high-quality, delicious food made with care. We value our local community, the freshness of homemade ingredients, and offering a welcoming, family-friendly experience."
* "Meet the Team" (Optional): If present, ensure placeholder avatars and text are neat. If not desired, ensure the section is cleanly removed or commented out.
3. menu.html (Menu Page):
* Sections: Ensure clear sections for Pizzas, Sandwiches, Sides, Drinks. (The "Sandwiches" part is key from Facebook).
* Content: Populate each section with at least 3-5 plausible placeholder items if current ones are too sparse. Example menu item:
* Name: "The Classic Pepperoni"
* Description: "Our signature homemade dough and sauce, topped with generous amounts of premium pepperoni and mozzarella."
* Price: "$14.50"
* Layout: Ensure the two-column desktop / single-column mobile card layout is working and looks good.
* Introductory Text: Consider adding a small blurb at the top like: "All our pizzas feature homemade dough and sauce, made fresh daily!"
4. contact.html (Contact Page):
* Contact Information (Left Column/Info Area):
* Display correct Address, Phone (tel: link), Email (mailto: link).
* List Hours of Operation clearly (Mon-Sun: 11 AM - 9 PM).
* Netlify Form (Right Column/Form Area):
* Verify the form has name="contact", method="POST", data-netlify="true", netlify-honeypot="bot-field", and the hidden inputs (form-name, bot-field).
* Ensure fields (Name, Email, Phone, Message) are present and the submit button is styled.
* Check basic JS validation for required fields.
* Map Placeholder: Ensure the div for the map placeholder mentions the correct address: Google Map Embed for 97 Bangor St, Augusta, ME Here.
5. 404.html:
* Ensure a friendly message and a clear link back to index.html.
* Footer content should be consistent.
IV. js/script.js Review:
Verify the mobile navigation toggle, testimonial slider logic, smooth scroll (if any specific anchors were intended), and dynamic footer year injection are all functioning correctly without console errors.
Output Request:
Provide the updated code for ALL relevant files: index.html, about.html, menu.html, contact.html, 404.html, css/style.css, and js/script.js. If netlify.toml was correctly generated before, it likely doesn't need changes unless directly instructed. Present each file in its own fenced code block.
